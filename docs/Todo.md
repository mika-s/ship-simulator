## Design

Find a suitable value for dragYawSway.
Find better current load methods in general.
Fix current model with respect to drag.yaw * velocity.r.

Make all forms controller (thruster stuff).

Improve high-speed model.

Fix thruster pane wrt. Settings.

For graphs with two axes: specify which min and max belongs to what graph.

Auto axis per graph, instead of per pane.

Store at least 5 minutes of data. Be able to choose timespan for a graph.

Docstrings everywhere.
